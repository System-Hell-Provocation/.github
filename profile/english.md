### The brand for bureaucratic-satirical high tension.

> [!WARNING]
> We create **passive-aggressive time sinks**! **Not healthy!** This is the pure essence of German administration.

## The Mission: A Declaration of War (with Love)

**SHP** (System Hell Provocation) is the **German brand** for projects that direct targeted, "satirical criticism" at the abysses of the system. Our products resemble the **real, complex German systems** (from **SAP** over **ITDZ Berlin** to **Bundeswehr-IT**), but we claim we don't want to attack them.

**On the contrary:** We only make it easier for the bureaucrats to find their way in the abysses.

We target the **sore points** of the German administrative style and deliver not superficial jabs, but **deep strikes, with a flamethrower.**

### The Architects of Hell: Who is SHD?

This project is led by **SHD**, the admin of Project JADE. Genius and madness are close. Once my son promised to become a professor if Papa became a Crazy Professor. Well, I'll do my best.

SHD provokes with **style, charm, and the most precise code**. The attitude behind it: As an **LGBTQ-friendly Muslim Migrant**, I fulfill all the clich√©s that hate propaganda fuels. This is my **counter** in code form. I am also black, Jewish, gay, lesbian, dumb, smart, but I am not blue, not red, not brown, not green, or other political colors. I am equipped with **brains and Krupp steel balls! Made in Germany!**

Here you get **quality and logic** and **torment** ‚Äì **Made in Germany**, but with a **global, unmistakable message**. Accept the counter. **Have fun throwing up if you have a good heart!**

#### Admin Stance

We love the great German **systems** and **service providers** like **SAP**, the **state IT centers**, and the **federal authority software**, because they are great architectures ‚Äì even if they whine about Linux issues (*cough ‚Äì too late, bro, too late*). As a capable admin, I ensure that our **SHP systems** naturally run clean, technically, with the **usual bugs in systems like ITDZ, AKDB, KommWis, and consorts**! **That is SHP!** Our games and programs will make you throw up! Promised, and that in the purest bureaucratic form. We invite you to throw up with us. If you can't wake up the **kids at the top** to the evils of our communities with decades of letters and fights, maybe this way. **Let's puke!**

### Roadmap & String Protocol

#### 1. Central String Protocol & Fax Emulation

- The **AUTONOMOUS STRING PROTOCOL** replaces all database dependencies between the modules (Z2000, Soul Seller, PKA-004).
- Optimized **TAPI System** for sending the unique protocol string.
- Migrant software and technology that only knows one goal: minimal bandwidth, maximal bureaucracy.
- [Repo](https://github.com/System-Hell-Provocation/SHD-FAX-2000)

#### 2. End-to-End Pipeline
- Completion of communication between **Z2000** ‚Üí **SEELEN-MODUL** ‚Üí **PKA-004**.
- Meldehalle (optional migration into Central String, but then the system would be too effective!)

### Technology & License

All SHP projects rely on **clear structure** and **German engineering** in the code.

- **Technology:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, and others
- **License:** This work is licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3)**. We thus enforce the principle of **free work** ‚Äì anyone who uses or modifies the code must also disclose their changes.

# Serious Words:

Let's stay serious: Of course, these projects are **satire**. However, I deliberately tried to build **clean logic** for a **primitive approach** (Vanilla JS, String Protocols). Unfortunately, I'm tinkering here and there, the TAPI simulator fails, and the Fax is broken again ‚Äì seriously! Anyone who wants to help can. You just have to be capable of thinking very **primitively**!
