### The brand for bureaucratic-satirical high tension.

> [!WARNING]
> We create passive-aggressive time-wasters! Not healthy!

## The Mission: A Declaration of War (with Love)

**SHP** (System Hell Provocation) is the **German brand** for projects that deliver targeted, satirical criticism of the abyssal parts of the system. Our products resemble the **real, complex German systems** (like SAP and co.), but we claim not to want to attack them.

**On the contrary:** We only make it easier for bureaucrats to find their way around the abyss.

I (we) aim at the **sore spots** of the German administrative style and deliver not superficial jabs but **deep strikes‚Äîwith a flamethrower.**

## The Architects of Hell: Who is SHD?

This project is led by **SHD**, the admin of Project JADE. Genius and madness are close. Once my son promised to become a professor if dad became a mad professor. Well, I‚Äôll do my best.

SHD provokes with **style, charm, and precise code**. The attitude: As an **LGBTQ-friendly Muslim migrant**, I fulfill all the clich√©s that hate propaganda feeds on. This is my **counter** in code form. I am black, Jewish, gay, lesbian, dumb, smart, but I am not blue, not red, not brown, not green or any other political color. I am of **brain and Krupp-steel balls! Made in Germany!**

Here you get **quality and logic** and **torment** ‚Äî **Made in Germany**, but with a **global, unmistakable message**. Take the counter. **Have fun throwing up, if you have a good heart!**

### Admin Attitude

We (I) love the big German companies like SAP and co., because they are awesome companies ‚Äî even if they snarl about Linux stuff (*cough ‚Äì too late, bro, too late*). As a competent admin, I make sure our **SHP systems** run technically clean, with the **usual bugs found in systems like ITDZ and the like**! **That‚Äôs SHP!** A company whose games and programs will make you puke! Promised, and fully bureaucratic. We invite you to puke along. If decades of letters and fights can‚Äôt wake the **kids at the top** to the evils in our communities, then maybe this will. **Let‚Äôs puke!**
